# Sovereign VPN — Smart Contract Audit Brief

## Overview

Sovereign VPN is an NFT-gated, decentralized VPN service built on Ethereum. Users holding Memes by 6529 ERC-1155 tokens gain VPN access. Node operators stake ETH and must hold a designated operator card. All session/subscription revenue flows to a community treasury, and governance distributes rewards to operators.

## Contracts in Scope

| SubscriptionManager.sol | 339 | OZ Ownable2Step, ReentrancyGuard |
| PayoutVault.sol | 242 | OZ Ownable2Step, ReentrancyGuard, SafeERC20 |
| **Total** | **1,528** | |

TestMemes.sol (34 lines) is a test-only ERC-1155 mock and is NOT in scope.

Solidity version: `^0.8.24`

## Key Invariants

1. **Card gating**: Only holders of `operatorCardId` on the Memes ERC-1155 can call `NodeRegistry.register()` and `reactivate()`.
2. **Revenue routing (operatorShareBps = 0)**: When operator share is 0%, all payment goes to `treasuryBalance`. The vault should never receive 0-value calls. (Bug found and fixed during integration testing — see "Known Issues" below.)
3. **PayoutVault crediting**: Only `authorizedSources` (SessionManager, SubscriptionManager) can call `creditOperator()`.
4. **Payout execution**: Only `payoutExecutor` can call `processPayout()` / `processBatchPayout()`.
5. **Ownership**: All admin functions use `Ownable2Step` (two-step transfer). Intent is to transfer to a Gnosis Safe multisig post-deployment.
6. **Staking**: Operators must stake >= `minStake` ETH. Slashing deducts from stake and accumulates in `slashedFunds`. Slashed operators cannot reactivate.
7. **Session lifecycle**: One active session per user. Session payment is locked on open and distributed on close.
8. **Subscription lifecycle**: One active subscription per user. Payment is distributed immediately on subscribe/renew.

## ETH Flow

```
User pays for session/subscription
        │
        ▼
operatorPayout = payment * operatorShareBps / 10000
treasuryPayout = payment - operatorPayout

if operatorPayout > 0:
    if payoutVault configured:
        → PayoutVault.creditOperator{value: operatorPayout}(node)
    else:
        → operatorBalance[node] += operatorPayout  (legacy mode)

treasuryBalance += treasuryPayout

Owner calls distributeRewards(operators, amounts):
    → treasuryBalance -= sum(amounts)
    → operatorBalance[each] += amounts[each]

Operators call withdrawOperatorEarnings():
    → ETH sent to msg.sender
```

## Known Issues (Found & Fixed)

### PayoutVault ZeroAmount Revert (Fixed)

**Severity**: High (broke session close entirely when operatorShareBps=0 and PayoutVault was configured)

When `operatorShareBps = 0`, `closeSession()` and `_distributePayment()` computed `operatorPayout = 0` but still called `payoutVault.creditOperator{value: 0}()`, which reverted with `ZeroAmount()`. Fixed by guarding with `if (operatorPayout > 0)` before the vault call.

**Affected files**: SessionManager.sol (line 210), SubscriptionManager.sol (line 330)

## Areas of Concern for Auditors

1. **Reentrancy in withdrawals**: `withdrawOperatorEarnings()` and `withdrawTreasury()` use the checks-effects-interactions pattern with `nonReentrant`, but verify no edge cases exist with the `payoutVault.creditOperator()` external call during `closeSession()`.

2. **`distributeRewards()` trust model**: Owner can distribute any amount up to `treasuryBalance` to any addresses. No timelock, vesting, or on-chain governance. This is by design (off-chain TDH-weighted governance), but should be documented as a centralization risk.

3. **`_removeFromList()` in NodeRegistry**: Swap-and-pop pattern for unbounded arrays. Verify no index corruption if called in unexpected states.

4. **`operatorCardId` mutability**: Recently changed from `immutable` to mutable with `setOperatorCardId()` onlyOwner setter. Allows governance to change which card is required without redeployment. Verify this doesn't create a window where existing operators become ineligible unexpectedly (note: card check only on `register()` and `reactivate()`, not on `heartbeat()` or other operations).

5. **PayoutVault `emergencyWithdrawETH()`**: Allows owner to sweep all ETH including pending operator payouts. This is an intentional safety valve but represents a rug risk if ownership is compromised.

6. **Price calculation rounding**: `(pricePerHour * duration) / 3600` in SessionManager rounds down, potentially allowing slightly underpaid sessions for non-hour-aligned durations.

7. **`slash()` percentage math**: `(stakedAmount * slashPercent) / 100` rounds down. A 1-wei stake with 50% slash would slash 0 wei.

8. **No `receive()` or `fallback()` on SessionManager/SubscriptionManager**: These contracts hold ETH but can only receive it through `payable` functions. Verify no scenario where ETH can be locked.
